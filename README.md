## A bit about me

Hey! I'm a Power Platform and Dynamics 365 developer based in the UK. I'm a fan of open source and learning new things on the pro-code side. I've got a [blog](https://www.calumharrison.com/) too where I share my insights Power Pages and Azure related. 

## What I'm working on 

- Focussed on buiding small open-source software tools to help with Power Pages and D365 development. 
- Improve my developer skills and share with others.
